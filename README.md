# Agrobot
A bot designed for performing basic agricultural task (weeding and spraying)
I was working for _**Mechanical Module**_ which included the complete physical designing of the bot.

## Sub divisions
The complete physical structure is broadly divided into 4 major parts 
1. CHASSIS
1. DRIVE MODULE
1. WEEDER (WEED-REMOVER)
1. SPRAYER

## My Contribution
Designing the complete _drive module_ , _weeder_ , _sprayer_. Designing of _chassis_ was taken care of my project partner.

####  _**Drive module**_
Complete bot is mounted on 4 such drive modules making our bot a 4-wheel driven bot
It consists of a DC motor that drives the wheel through a two-stage transmission. First stage is the chain drive and then the in-wheel planetary gearbox.
Planetary gearbox has following application-
  * Transform torque
  * Transform Speed/RPM

####  _**Weeder**_
* Initial prototype - It consisted of a high rpm motor connected with pair of fibre string / blades of cutter. It is surrounded by two toothed wheels to uproot weeds
Bot consist of 2 cutter and 4 toothed wheels
* Final design - A frame supporting two perpendicular rack and pinion on which is mounted a linear actuator which finally holts the cutting motor and blades (made of thin fibre)

####  _**Sprayer**_
* 1st prototype- Two sprayers are mounted at the back of the bot. It functions by using a water pump, pumping the liquid to the spraying nozzle.  
* 2nd Prototupe- A spraying channel supporing a flow pipe and ending at different nozzles.

####  _**Final design**_
Culminating the all the modules we got the final design
